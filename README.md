Testing css units


## em unit
The em unit use the current font-size. 
1em: is the same as the font-size of the current element.

Example:

if the font-size defined in the html tag is 14px and we apply a font-size of "1.2em" a p tag, for example, we will have the following font-size:

14px * 1.2 = 16.8px

## rem unit
rem: The rem (root em) works in exactly the same way as the em, except that it will always equal the size of the default base font-size; inherited font sizes will have no effect

## vw and vh unit
vw, vh: Respectively these are 1/100th of the width of the viewport, and 1/100th of the height of the viewport. Again, these are not as widely supported as rems.
